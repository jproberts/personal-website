I am currently in my third year of pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering at 
Johns Hopkins University. In my two years of study, I have been exposed to
C and Java in my programming courses, as well as Cadence and LTSpice in my
VLSI and circuit design courses. I've also had the opportunity to work as a
course assistant for Intermediate Programming under Professors Sarah More,
Ben Langmead and Misha Kazhdan.
