# James Roberts

Welcome! I'm James. I'm **currently a computer engineering student**. Not a web developer.
I chose computer engineering as a major so that I could learn how the hardware that
I'm writing code on works. However, I definitely prefer to write code. I'm most
**interested in systems design**. Not web development.
