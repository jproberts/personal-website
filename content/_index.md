Welcome! I'm James. I'm **currently a computer engineering student**.
I chose computer engineering as a major to learn how the hardware that I'm writing
code on works. However, I do prefer the software side of computers. I'm **most
interested in systems design**. I'm also **intrigued by human computer interaction**.
I am not, however, interested in web development.

So why create this website?

 * to show people who I am beyond my resume. Somewhere they can [learn more about me](/about)
 that I might not include on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jproberts1012/) or
 [my resume](/JamesRobertsResume.pdf).
 * to be able to publish [my writings](/writings) in a form that I can control.
 * to showcase [my coding](/coding) projects beyond the uniform interface of
[my Github repositories](https://github.com/jproberts).

And then there was the motivation to just find out if I *could* put my limited HMTL
and CSS knowledge to work and create a website. It's still a work in progress.
(Anyone reading this on mobile, I applaud you for reading this far. For a more
enjoyable experience, please come back on your computer.)

Anyway, I'm happy that you were able to stumble upon my site. If there's anything that
you can't find, or something that you found so interesting that you want to discuss further,
please feel free to [contact me](/contact).
