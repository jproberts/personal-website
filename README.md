## Personal Website
*Under Development*

This repository holds all files for my personal website. The site is built
using Hugo and will be hosted through GitHub Pages. 

This is my first website, and I'm learning a lot along the way. I don't plan on
doing very much web development, but I wanted to take some time and see what I
could hack together with my basic HTML, CSS, and Googling abilities. I made the
code public so that others can hopefully learn from mistakes and design choices
I've made.
